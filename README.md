## Using this script

1. Run the `run_analysis.R` script using R or R studio.
2. Observe the created files/folders:
   - `humanActivityRecognition.zip`, containing the compressed data
   - `UCI HAR Dataset`, containing the uncompressed data
   - `x_summary.txt`, containing the mean and standard deviation of each feature across the test and training sets
